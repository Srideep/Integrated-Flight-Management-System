## Summary
Add MATLAB unit tests for `calculate_cross_track_error.m` ensuring correct sign and magnitude for on-track and off-track positions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- New test file `test_calculate_cross_track_error.m` covering on-track, left-of-course, and right-of-course scenarios.
- Tests run with MATLAB's unit testing framework without errors.
